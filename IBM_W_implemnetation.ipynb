Thoughts? \t\"Hello everyone. I am not sure where to begin, so I will just ramble and hopefully it comes together. I am a 21 year old male about to be 22 in a few months. Since late June of 2015, I have had horrible anxiety and possibly (most likely?) very bad hypochondria. On that night in June when things went bad, I went to my sister's house to smoke weed with her and her friends. I had smoked weed religiously for a little over a year before this event, so it seemed like no big deal. I get there, I take literally 2 bong hits and I just didn't feel right afterwards. I was not a \"\"lightweight\"\" when it came to weed and I didn't feel uncomfortable in social situations, this one included, but something felt \"\"off\"\". After a few hits my heart raced insanely, I went to the bathroom to wash my face off to see if I would feel better, then I immediately had to leave the house. I felt like I was blacking out, my vision was blurry, and I literally thought I was dying. I drove back to my house next door with my girlfriend who also felt strange, and then panicked for 30mins-1hr until the ambulance arrived, who I had called, because my chest hurt soooooo bad. They give me some valium or something and send me on my way. I worked an insanely long shift the following monday and then quit the job because I thought I had something wrong with me. \n",
        "\n",
        " For a month after this event I became more aware of my body and was convinced for a bit that my heart was always racing. I felt a little dizzy but was otherwise fine other than the health concern. I was trying to unwind for a month or so until I could be calm again and get a new job that I enjoyed more. Somewhere along the line, I went to walmart and then dizzyness out of the blue, went to the ER again, seemingly no issues. \n",
        "\n",
        "I was fine again for a while until I started getting these extreme aches underneath my ribcage, right at the area where your ribs drop off in your upper abdomen, above my stomach. I still have those to this day. Went the ER and was given a GI cocktail, basically strong as hell antacids, and for 5 mins I felt better but then it was back. Was diagnosed with GERD and took antacids, but it didn't help the pain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, since I had been sick for months at this point, around October my mother mentioned the possibility of me having the autoimmune disorder that she has, Sjogren's syndrome. A few days/weeks after mentioning this, I wake up with a swollen neck and can't turn it all the way, I feel like I have strep throat, and my submandibular salivary glands are swollen as hell. I also started feeling like I had POTS syndrome. When I lied down my heart was normal paced, when I stood it went haywire.\n",
        "\n",
        "I have had many more symptoms since then on and off but the ones that stick the most that seem debilitating to me know is the pain in my upper abdomen, some heartburn, air hunger all the time, extreme stress, swollen salivary glands and lymph nodes that hurt more/swell more when stressed and ache for hours, depression, agoraphobia to an extent but not severe, and I just feel awful. I assume I am a hypochondriac now but the pain feels so real. I don't know how to stop what I assume is muscular clenching in my upper ribs, I don't know how to calm my swollen salivary glands, and I don't know how not to obsess about my symptoms. I don't feel like physically the weed night destroyed me, but mentally I am not even close to the same person. This all happened 3 months after I turned 20 and in 3 months I am 22. I am seeing a therapist but cannot shake the fact that something is physically wrong with me, maybe autoimmune or something, because the physical symptoms won't subside. What the hell can I do to get my life back? I used to play video games for stress relief, now they stress me out/I can't focus because brainfog. Books I can't focus on/get in to. I play instruments and can't for the life of me progress on them because I get frustrated too easily. I have anger issues now too because I am so scared I am going to die and nobody knows what is wrong with me. If I think rationally, I guess anxiety could cause all these things, but it feels so real. I am terrified and I am the shell of the person that I used to be. I enjoy nothing, I am constantly changing my diet and lifestyle to try and cope, nothing seems to help me much so far. Social media is so toxic, multiplayer games are so toxic, etc. There are general things I could do like eat less junk food or clean the house more, but I try to do everything to such extremes. My anxiety makes me want \"\"all or nothing\"\" I guess. If I think about eating less crap food, I feel like I should never touch a beer or a joint(which I don't anyway because I would panic SO hard), makes me want to go vegan and never watch porn again, and just be a perfect saint of a person who makes no risks and doesn't enjoy life. I am rambling, I am sorry, what the hell can I do to get my life back. Any advice is very much appreciated. Would hypochondria ACTUALLY make my salivary glands swell up because my mind is convinced I have an autoimmune disorder? How do I stop it? :(''\n",

Most of my nights have been spent alone, despite the fact that I'm at university right now. I feel shitty almost all the time, whether it's stomach pain, migraines or crippling loneliness. I do have online friends but I don't like to bother them too much as it would become apparent just how lonely I am if I pour all my attention onto them. It feels as if I've wasted the last five years of my life whereas everyone else has either been building a future or has at least gone out with friends and enjoyed themselves. I was pretty suicidal at one point but managed to get over that. I have been in and out of therapy ever since and continue to go. I just don't see a scenario where I could come back from this.

It all has to do with what happened at the NYE party last year, which Iâ€™ve never properly explained to anyone before.

After finding out I didnâ€™t have any plans for the new yearâ€™s, a good friend (one that I would consider my best friend, though this is not mutual) invited me to come along to a party that she and her closest group of friends were attending. Iâ€™m usually nervous about going to places where I donâ€™t know most of the people, but since I had spent the previous new year with her and some of her friends too, and had a really fun time, I was sure it would be fine. Boy, was I wrong.\n",

        "Come the last day of the year, we meet up (her, 3 of her friends, and me) and head out to the party. The first thing I notice is that none of the friends were the ones I had hit it off with the year before â€“ ok, no big deal. Except that apart from when they first introduced themselves, they completely ignored me for the rest of the evening. On the way to the party they made some small talk and I tried to casually chime in, but without much success. \n",
        "We arrive at the party, greet the host, then my friend and her group make a beeline to the kitchen, sit in a closed circle, talking and laughing about inside stuff I donâ€™t understand. I stand around for a bit, but since thereâ€™s not much room and nobody invites me to join or even acknowledges my presence, I wander to the living room and awkwardly sit on the couch by myself. This goes on for about an hour, during which time I talked briefly to a few people that were also there (including this one girl who was actually really nice and the only person to show any interest).

Then I go to the bathroom and when I come back, my friend is having a grand old time with her group again and Iâ€™m back to being ignored. I figure it might be my fault, so I attempt to start a conversation with the people from the group by hovering around them with a drink in my hand, hoping they would make eye contact, make room for me, say something, or give me an opportunity to ask them a question, whatever â€“ nope.

        "The reason I took it so hard, I think, is because this was someone I really came to consider to be my best friend (as I said, this is not mutual â€“ she is an extremely social person and has a million friends): weâ€™ve spoken pretty much daily, both online and IRL, for the past 2+ years, about all kinds of things (some very personal ones, too). Our interactions have mostly been one-on-one (this is actually the case with all my friends, itâ€™s just how I like to talk to people). Being quite introverted, having a friend like this is a huge deal for me. So the party was like a micro representation of my actual place in her life. It felt like, sure, she pays attention to me when we talk, because who else is she going to pay attention to when itâ€™s just the two of us, but when sheâ€™s with her â€˜realâ€™ friends, I donâ€™t mean shit.

        "Hey everyone. So to cut right to the chase, I'm prescribed Viagra for ED. Sometimes I take it after a night of heavy drinking which I now know I shouldn't do. Anyway, a week ago, frustrated with the fact that after a previous night of heavy drinking I took a 100mg tablet and had some problems keeping an erection, I thought I would take 150mg to ensure I had a rock hard erection during sex. Well, due to the heavy drinking I'm sure, I had performance issues again, didn't sleep much, went to work the next day and then started reading online about how you shouldn't mix Viagra and alcohol and shouldn't take more than 150mg (max dose being 100mg).\n",

I've had plenty of anxiety problems in the past, including hypochondria, it's possible my head is playing tricks on me, but I swear my vision is blurrier than before (my right eye feels funny, not sure if it's eye pressure or it's been damaged, or if I'm obsessing over it) and I feel cloudy-headed and \"\"out of it\"\".\n",

I'm happy to support her as best I can but lately she's developed an aversion to sexual touch. She loves to cuddle, but anything more intimate than that seems to freak her out- Kissing makes her feel like she can't breathe, and any more serious touch makes her involuntarily shield her body with her arms and legs. After some awkward foreplay that doesn't seem to do anything for her, she eventually tells me to just jump to penetration, which is basically impossible because she's so tensed up. So then we give up and both feel crappy - she feels like she failed me, and I feel like a monster forcing myself upon her.\n",

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like whatever she's doing is working, so our sex life has basically died over the past few months. She's probably willing to do things for me still, but I feel too guilty and weird even asking at this point (even though I know it would probably help).\n",

        "I guess my question is to see if anyone has worked through a similar issue, or has advice for me as her partner?\"\t[deleted]\t\"Everyday I'm upset. Wether it's when I wake up or just before bed, doesn't matter it's all about the same amount of hell. It's not constant. It comes and goes. It can happen for no reason or by being triggered either by being annoyed, sad, angry or worried about something I can't control either because it's out of my control or because my anxiety causes me issues. With people, at work, my fiancÃ©. This sounds stupid but the only living thing I have patience with is my cat. She can sense when I'm stressed out. Some days I won't leave the bed until my fiancÃ© comes home from work. I feel extra guilt on top of general anxiety because of the financial issues my anxiety has caused in the past and continues to cause. As I get older with each year that passes I no longer have a desire to drink or do party drugs like my friends (I'm in college, it's common. Google molly) mainly because my come down and anxiety after substances is unbearable. Forgets hangover, my anxiety surrounding substances is crippling and I don't understand why. I can't even have a glass of wine before bed without waking up feeling like something isn't right. I have plans to speak to a professional and possibly start a medication. But I have hoops to jump through with my insurance first. Until then all I can do is calm myself down but as of lately it isn't easy and I fear it's taking a huge nose dive. I feel out of control. I get so angry at myself for not being able to control it. I just need some serious unique resources or advice as to why I'm so anxious about everything. For example if I forget to brush my teeth one morning it's all I think about. My teeth get sensitive just worrying about it. I walk on eggshells with everything I say every second of every day from fear of rejection or ridicule. I have strong opinions and it's not always ok with people. But my anxiety is taking away my voice and my personal power. I've become a pushover who feels like she's drowning in her own failure. My fiancÃ© does what he can but he doesn't understand it fully. I feel like a crazy person and I just wanna be able to relieve it a little bit until I can figure out what's right for me through professional counseling.\n",

I stopped messaging but the lack of response has made me extremely worried and anxious. I see her online in chatrooms and stuff but she hasn't been responding to messages for a few days and ignoring me, while chatting away with others in a chat. I used to sleep perfectly until I started to face this reality that I won't have anywhere to go in a few weeks and I have no support. I lay down to try to fall asleep but my heart starts racing. All day, my stomach makes gurgling sounds as a result of anxiety. The insomnia is to the point where I haven't slept in over 2 days and I have been averaging 0-3 hours lately. I think my adrenals and hormones are all out of whack. If I can't stay with her, I will have to stay in a shelter. In all fairness, she has said she has no problem with letting me stay with her, she just has to ask for approval first in a couple of weeks at their next house meeting and that they probably wouldn't have a problem with it. But I think somehow she will be convinced or talked out of it. In which case, I would have to stay in a homeless shelter.\t\"Hi, I'm 23 and I've never dated even once.

The only possible solution it seems to me is to learn how to help him through it.

Thoughts? \t\"Hello everyone. I am not sure where to begin, so I will just ramble and hopefully it comes together. I am a 21 year old male about to be 22 in a few months. Since late June of 2015, I have had horrible anxiety and possibly (most likely?) very bad hypochondria. On that night in June when things went bad, I went to my sister's house to smoke weed with her and her friends. I had smoked weed religiously for a little over a year before this event, so it seemed like no big deal. I get there, I take literally 2 bong hits and I just didn't feel right afterwards. I was not a \"\"lightweight\"\" when it came to weed and I didn't feel uncomfortable in social situations, this one included, but something felt \"\"off\"\". After a few hits my heart raced insanely, I went to the bathroom to wash my face off to see if I would feel better, then I immediately had to leave the house. I felt like I was blacking out, my vision was blurry, and I literally thought I was dying. I drove back to my house next door with my girlfriend who also felt strange, and then panicked for 30mins-1hr until the ambulance arrived, who I had called, because my chest hurt soooooo bad. They give me some valium or something and send me on my way. I worked an insanely long shift the following monday and then quit the job because I thought I had something wrong with me. \n",
        "\n",
        " For a month after this event I became more aware of my body and was convinced for a bit that my heart was always racing. I felt a little dizzy but was otherwise fine other than the health concern. I was trying to unwind for a month or so until I could be calm again and get a new job that I enjoyed more. Somewhere along the line, I went to walmart and then dizzyness out of the blue, went to the ER again, seemingly no issues. \n",
        "\n",
        "I was fine again for a while until I started getting these extreme aches underneath my ribcage, right at the area where your ribs drop off in your upper abdomen, above my stomach. I still have those to this day. Went the ER and was given a GI cocktail, basically strong as hell antacids, and for 5 mins I felt better but then it was back. Was diagnosed with GERD and took antacids, but it didn't help the pain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, since I had been sick for months at this point, around October my mother mentioned the possibility of me having the autoimmune disorder that she has, Sjogren's syndrome. A few days/weeks after mentioning this, I wake up with a swollen neck and can't turn it all the way, I feel like I have strep throat, and my submandibular salivary glands are swollen as hell. I also started feeling like I had POTS syndrome. When I lied down my heart was normal paced, when I stood it went haywire.\n",
        "\n",
        "I have had many more symptoms since then on and off but the ones that stick the most that seem debilitating to me know is the pain in my upper abdomen, some heartburn, air hunger all the time, extreme stress, swollen salivary glands and lymph nodes that hurt more/swell more when stressed and ache for hours, depression, agoraphobia to an extent but not severe, and I just feel awful. I assume I am a hypochondriac now but the pain feels so real. I don't know how to stop what I assume is muscular clenching in my upper ribs, I don't know how to calm my swollen salivary glands, and I don't know how not to obsess about my symptoms. I don't feel like physically the weed night destroyed me, but mentally I am not even close to the same person. This all happened 3 months after I turned 20 and in 3 months I am 22. I am seeing a therapist but cannot shake the fact that something is physically wrong with me, maybe autoimmune or something, because the physical symptoms won't subside. What the hell can I do to get my life back? I used to play video games for stress relief, now they stress me out/I can't focus because brainfog. Books I can't focus on/get in to. I play instruments and can't for the life of me progress on them because I get frustrated too easily. I have anger issues now too because I am so scared I am going to die and nobody knows what is wrong with me. If I think rationally, I guess anxiety could cause all these things, but it feels so real. I am terrified and I am the shell of the person that I used to be. I enjoy nothing, I am constantly changing my diet and lifestyle to try and cope, nothing seems to help me much so far. Social media is so toxic, multiplayer games are so toxic, etc. There are general things I could do like eat less junk food or clean the house more, but I try to do everything to such extremes. My anxiety makes me want \"\"all or nothing\"\" I guess. If I think about eating less crap food, I feel like I should never touch a beer or a joint(which I don't anyway because I would panic SO hard), makes me want to go vegan and never watch porn again, and just be a perfect saint of a person who makes no risks and doesn't enjoy life. I am rambling, I am sorry, what the hell can I do to get my life back. Any advice is very much appreciated. Would hypochondria ACTUALLY make my salivary glands swell up because my mind is convinced I have an autoimmune disorder? How do I stop it? :(''\n",

When I get like this, well, it's pretty tough for me to remember what life is like when I've got anxiety sorted or at least, I'm able to manage, and since uh, well I'm currently both depressed and anxious, I have reason to doubt my memory.

Well, due to the heavy drinking I'm sure, I had performance issues again, didn't sleep much, went to work the next day and then started reading online about how you shouldn't mix Viagra and alcohol and shouldn't take more than 150mg (max dose being 100mg).\n",

She loves to cuddle, but anything more intimate than that seems to freak her out- Kissing makes her feel like she can't breathe, and any more serious touch makes her involuntarily shield her body with her arms and legs. After some awkward foreplay that doesn't seem to do anything for her, she eventually tells me to just jump to penetration, which is basically impossible because she's so tensed up.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like whatever she's doing is working, so our sex life has basically died over the past few months.

Wether it's when I wake up or just before bed, doesn't matter it's all about the same amount of hell. It's not constant. It comes and goes.

Google molly) mainly because my come down and anxiety after substances is unbearable. Forgets hangover, my anxiety surrounding substances is crippling and I don't understand why. I can't even have a glass of wine before bed without waking up feeling like something isn't right. I have plans to speak to a professional and possibly start a medication. But I have hoops to jump through with my insurance first. Until then all I can do is calm myself down but as of lately it isn't easy and I fear it's taking a huge nose dive. I feel out of control. I get so angry at myself for not being able to control it. I just need some serious unique resources or advice as to why I'm so anxious about everything. For example if I forget to brush my teeth one morning it's all I think about. My teeth get sensitive just worrying about it. I walk on eggshells with everything I say every second of every day from fear of rejection or ridicule. I have strong opinions and it's not always ok with people. But my anxiety is taking away my voice and my personal power. I've become a pushover who feels like she's drowning in her own failure. My fiancÃ© does what he can but he doesn't understand it fully.

In about a month, I am going to pack up a bag of clothes and my laptop and head across the country and start new in an area with more jobs/resources. I have no family and no real friends. I have what I think is undiagnosed Autism or Aspergers. I had an online friend that said I could probably stay with her and that she would think about it, but I think I may have became too excited and started messaging her too often and saying I really need a place and to please give me a chance and kind of repeating myself a little and sounding very desperate. She hasn't texted me in a few days and I've been worried. I constantly check for a message from her and have become obsessed with thinking and worrying about it. I'm really worried she will say no. I stopped messaging but the lack of response has made me extremely worried and anxious. I see her online in chatrooms and stuff but she hasn't been responding to messages for a few days and ignoring me, while chatting away with others in a chat. I used to sleep perfectly until I started to face this reality that I won't have anywhere to go in a few weeks and I have no support. I lay down to try to fall asleep but my heart starts racing. All day, my stomach makes gurgling sounds as a result of anxiety. The insomnia is to the point where I haven't slept in over 2 days and I have been averaging 0-3 hours lately. I think my adrenals and hormones are all out of whack. If I can't stay with her, I will have to stay in a shelter. In all fairness, she has said she has no problem with letting me stay with her, she just has to ask for approval first in a couple of weeks at their next house meeting and that they probably wouldn't have a problem with it. But I think somehow she will be convinced or talked out of it. In which case, I would have to stay in a homeless shelter.\t\"Hi, I'm 23 and I've never dated even once.
